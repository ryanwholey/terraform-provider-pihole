# Pi-hole Provider

The [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) provider is used to manage Pi-hole resources. The provider should be configured with the Pi-hole URL and the admin password (not the hashed web password).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pihole = {
      source = "ryanwholey/pihole"
    }
  }
}

provider "pihole" {
  url      = "https://pihole.domain.com" # PIHOLE_URL
  password = var.pihole_password         # PIHOLE_PASSWORD
}

provider "pihole" {
  url = "https://pihole.domain.com" # PIHOLE_URL

  # Experimental, requires Pi-hole Web Interface >= 5.11.0
  api_token = var.pihole_api_token # PIHOLE_API_TOKEN
}
```

**Note**: Authenticating via `api_token` is currently experimental and requires a Pi-hole Web Interface version of `>= 5.11.0` (see [release notes](https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/releases/tag/v5.11)). The Pi-hole API has just recently began supporting API token authentication for specific resources. Currently the following resources are manageable via API token:

- `pihole_cname_record`
- `pihole_dns_record`
